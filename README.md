## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

For this project I used HTML and CSS to recreate the Level Ground site visually.





## Lessons Learned:
This project was one of the first projects where I used Flexbox. While learning Flexbox I came to a point where I needed to put my skills into hands on, real life practice and used this project for just that.
